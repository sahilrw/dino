# Dino Game

## Description

Dino Game is a simple yet addictive game built using Python and Pygame library. It's inspired by the classic Chrome Dinosaur game, where the player controls a dinosaur that must jump over obstacles to survive. The game features a dinosaur character, cactus obstacles, and a score system. I have created a simple clone of the game. Feel free to look through the code and run it.

## Features

- Control a dinosaur character to jump over obstacles.
- Dodge incoming cactus obstacles to survive.
- Track and display the player's score as they progress through the game.
- Simple controls: Press the spacebar to make the dinosaur jump.
- Press Enter to restart the game after a game over.

5. If the dinosaur collides with an obstacle, the game will end. Press Enter to restart and play again.
